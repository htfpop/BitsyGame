UPDATED :D

added logic to prevent user from walking out of living room until they found the picture
added logic to prevent user from going into master BR until they have found the following:
	- Knife (kitchen)
	- Newspaper (Kitchen)
	- first set of bloody footprints (olivia's bathroom)

playtest couple more times and make sure doors are locked, grammar/spelling, 
walls are in their place and player cant no-clip through tiles

other than that just submission.
